# Sketchdance Jitter - Stop Motion Animation

Jitter is intended as a super-simple stop motion animation tool for kids to learn with.

It is a part of a larger, more ambitious [Sketchdance](https://hackmd.io/SIWsBN1UTNugwO6q3lMARg?view) project that is in progress.

Some docs, known bugs, and todo list are in the main [design document](https://hackmd.io/G4fFJGKLTiSIB6najlYO_Q?view).
